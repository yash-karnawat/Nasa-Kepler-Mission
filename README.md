The NASA Kepler Mission project was built using React for the interface and MongoDB for database management. Kepler, launched in 2009, was a groundbreaking mission in exoplanet discovery, monitoring 150,000+ stars for subtle brightness dips caused by transiting planets, aiming to identify Earth-sized worlds in distant solar systems.
